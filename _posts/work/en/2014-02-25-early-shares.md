about: Early Shares is an online equity crowd-funding service that turns anyone into an investor by connecting them with business owners looking to fund and sell a stake of their company.

status: The project is finished, online, and has been used for various users.

what_has_been_done: We worked on this project for one year, time we worked with no breaks, and today it's done. Now the project is being improved by the client's own team. It's a great example of a company that started with us, made the project grow until a size and then chose to continue work with his own team. Success!

customer_experience: My experience with HE:labs was great and the project was a huge success. What you guys did and your skills in web development make any task seem easy, which is amazing when dealing with web development companies. That is pretty impressive for all standards.

customer_name: Maurice Lopes, Early Shares.
