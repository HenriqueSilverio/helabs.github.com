about: Sala de Ideias (Idea Room) is an online platform founded by three psychologists to inspire balance and satisfaction in our lives. Weekly discourses are shared with new learnings and experiences.

status: The project is online and being used for sharing weekly texts.

what_has_been_done: This project has started as a MVP project to be released and is now on HE:labs Help service. It's a good example of someone who launched his idea and chose to continue with us.



customer_experience: HE:labs was the company that gave us the fastest time within the market, without compromising quality. Getting a project online in just three days, it really is a mission beyond the expected, we have never seen it before. The work was perfect, they were able to capture and build everything that we wanted to our project.

customer_name: Fabiane Gori e Helena Cardoso, founders of Sala de Ideias.
