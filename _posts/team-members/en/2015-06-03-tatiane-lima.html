bio:
- She always thought "creating" is magic. When she was a child, inspired by Beakman’s show, she wanted to be inventor. When she grew up, found out that creativity and knowledge don’t come with a scientist's coat. She learned with design that paper and pencil is enough to create and resolve big problems.
- She loves internet, meme, cartoon, your state, Bahia and Yakult, but what she really like is people.
