bio:
- Leandro is a 2D animator with a background in web design, graphic and logo design, and advertising. In other words, he does beautiful images that sell.
- He had his first agile software development experience back in 2007, in a team led by Vin√≠cius Teles, one of XP pioneers in Brazil. It was there that he found out how impressive agile methods could be, and how cool it was to bend CSS code to his will. At the same time he watched the first \#horaextra meetings gain momentum, grow into Startup DEV and culminate in HE:labs.
- He loves animation, innovative interface design, deep conversation with small groups of friends, and anything related to the theme of personal development and making the world better.
