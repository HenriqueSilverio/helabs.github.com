      <p>We turn your ideas into web products, from zero to millions of users!</p>
      <p>We set up a team for your project that can start with a minimum of 2 people and can have as many as required, according to your needs.</p>
      <p>Teams work exclusively on projects, no one is shared across projects.</p>
      <p>Our contract is week to week and can be canceled at any time. You can hire us for just one week to test our services and choose to continue or not. A lot can be done. The team can also be increased or decreased at any time.</p>
      <p>Web projects take 2 weeks to 12 weeks, in general, to reach the point of being launched. This is also the maximum time that we give to any client to launch the project or go to production. Products that work tend to require continuous development forever until they are disabled.</p>
      <p>We work with weekly iterations. In a standard four-week month, we delivered four versions of the software. Our work process is based on eXtreme Programming. <a href="/en/magic">See more details of the methodology</a>.</p>
      <p>We have a vested interest in always delivering the very best value for your dollar since we're judged on weekly results.</p>
